BAR Design Document
===================

*This is a UCLA CS35L project*



# Overall

BAR, Boxes of Ananoumous Response is a Web Application that is based on Facebook login with Instgram.

- What does the application do? Describe its main functionality in a few sentences
    - Users log in with Instagram.
    - Users can open question boxes towards their Instagram friends list. When a question box is
    opened, other users can ask this user questions (either anonymous or displaying their username), and the owner of the question box can answer questions. When in a question box, all users can see all the previous questions that have been answered by the owner. Users can close and reopen the question box to their friend's list.
    - Users can open response boxes towards their instagram friends list. When a response box is opened, the user can post a question and other contents.
    - This app supports users to ask another user questions (which supports both anonymous and real name status when asking) while the user that has been asked has the option to answer the question (in real name status).
    - Under a user’s page, this app displays all the questions that the user has received and answered.
    - To support a user posting public questions (which supports both anonymous and real name status when asking) for other users to answer the questions (in anonymous or real name status)
- What motivated the project idea? For example, is there a particular pain point you are looking to solve?
    - We are creating the project to let users communicate with their friends in another way by
    providing the option of asking questions anonymously. There’s currently no app similar to that on the web that can integrate anonymous asking with a user's close friends. More specifically, there are apps in which users can ask and answer questions on the web (such as Quora), and ask and answer questions to their friends in real name status (such as through DM in different chatting apps like Discord, Facebook, and Instagram). Thus, we perceive a gap in communication that there isn’t any application that enables users to ask questions to their friends anonymously.
    - The pandemic has shaped our way of life enormously, especially by making communication more difficult. To solve this problem, our project expands another way of communication so that users can develop better relationships with their friends.
    - For example, we found it different to ask a question to a friend online through direct message. We created this app so that people will not be afraid of asking their friends questions which can greatly improve their friendship. Such friendship is essential during the pandemic.
